			<h2>Welcome to <strong>SciencePolicy.org</strong></h2>

			<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>Establish a connection between City Hall and local scientists to research, with open science principles, community problems and draft science-driven policy.</p>

			<h3>Significance</h3>
				<p>Improving local communities through education, research, and development.</p>

			<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
				<p>Bills passed by lawmakers become more well informed, and the research science will positively impact local communities.</p>

			<h3>Materials</h3>
				<p>3,871 degree-granting schools[1] with the 19,000+ 'incorporated places'[2][3]</p>

			<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>1. <strong>Create a reporting structure for City Halls or Municipalities to their local Research Institutions.</strong> Problems in the local community that need to be researched will be communicated, researched and reported back in the form of science-guided publicy policy.</p>
				<p>2. <strong>Drive research within degree-granting schools that looks at community-indentified problems.</strong> Creating a way for Universities and Colleges to easily find local problems in their communities will help benefit the local community and provide direct examples of research for funding applications.</p>
				<p>3. <strong>Pass science-driven policies that can be used as a template for other incorporated places dealing with similar problems.</strong> Through open source and transparent methods, science-driven public policy will be available to all.</p>

			<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<p>Number of bills passed in local legislatures, percentage of 'incorporated places' that have connected to a local degree-granting school, number of bills available to be drafted into legislation.</p>
